| October 30 | 11-11:55 | I thought about the problem, and realized I had to create my own version of a Hashmap to make it work. I did a proof of concept using the built in Hashmap Method in java, and it worked. So now I am sure of what I want to do, which is most likely hashing as that's what a hashmap does.  |
