I did a proof of concept using the built in Hashmap Method in java, and it worked. So now I am sure of what I want to do, which is most likely hashing as that's what a hashmap does. |

I started by creating my Hash function and some instance variables that I need throughout the code. I also revised the code in the Finder file to make sure everything is working, and now I can clearly see the few functions that I need to go ahead and make. |

I had to start by fixing some of my instance variables, and choosing values for default hash size and radix. Radix was pretty obvious to choose 256 for each character in extended ascii, and I ended up doing 997 for starting table size because it is large and prime. |

It started off relatively simple as all I had to do was hash the key, and then do the Linear Probing method to find where to put it, but got much harder when I had to resize the hashmap in some cases. Like any logical human being, I decided to leave a comment saying "resize" and worry about it later, not now. I then did my "get" function, which was pretty easy as it was the same concept of linear probing that I just did in the previous one. Something I saw that I didn't like was that I had to use .equals for the linear probing the second time around. I then tested the code, and it worked for one of the cases. Now I will try to do the resize and then I should be good to go hopefully. |
| November 5 | 10:00-10:30pm | I finished creating my resize function and doing my debugging. The resize function was quite challenging as I had to find a way to copy over the data into a new blank array that is twice the size. In order to do this, I first copied the data into placeholder arrays so I could set my two actual arrays to blank. This allowed me to reuse my insert function recursively to add back in the previous data into the bigger arrays. I also had to make a boolean so the insert function wouldn't go back into the resize while it was simultaneously being resized, though I'm not sure if that was completely necessary. Finally, i addressed a bug in the get function, where I didn't check for null before the while loop which caused an error. After doing all of this, the code now works great! One thing I notice is that Products is very slow, which indicates a big resize that happens.  |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
